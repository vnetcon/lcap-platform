# Low-Code Appliction Platform (LCAP)

For us Low-Code Application Platform (LCAP) is a server and set of tools for fast, easy and cheap:
* REST API development for Web and Mobile Apps
  * Low-Code? Only SQL skills required.
* Data processing for reporting tools
  * Low-Code? Only SQL skills required. 
* Easy way to handle Special Cases (These usually always exist)
  * Talend ESB for Low-Code data processing (Drag and drop visual compnents).
  * Small pieces of java code embedded into Talend if needed (the last option)
* Very easy way to start without installing software
  * Download zip and extract it
  * Start servers with one click
  * Write SQL 
  
In corner cases design your visual no-code Talend job (embed java if needed, hopefully not)  
And on top this we want this to be possible on your own servers __without vendor lock__.  
In short: You can host your servers where ever you want.
